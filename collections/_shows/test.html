  text: "My sister Deborah Brown and I are longtime public radio donors and we are pleased to support PRX through the Harold and Colleen Brown Family Foundation. Thanks to our parents, starting as children we were exposed to world events. So The World is one of our favorite programs. When our father was Jimmy Carter's Secretary of Defense, world events could be personally stomach churning. But now they are a welcome diversion from US domestic politics. The World presents a nonpartisan view of world affairs, including reports from correspondence and interviews with world leaders. Best of all the reports cover not just the top news, there are cultural vignettes on everything from Armenian winemakers to female Zambian rappers. The hosts, Marco Worman and Carolyn Beeler, wrap it all up and make the case that Americans must recognize our connection to the rest of the world."

<p>With hosts in Boston and San Diego and correspondents on six continents, <i>The World</i> from PRX and GBH remains the premier source for international journalism on public radio. Carolyn Beeler joined Marco Werman as co-host, bringing her expertise as the show's longtime environment reporter and editor to this new role. <i>The World</i> continued reporting initiatives covering the intersection of religion and nationalism around the globe with support from the Henry Luce Foundation, while also bringing listeners insights into education and how countries beyond the US pay for it, supported by the Lumina Foundation.</p> 

<p>With funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, <i>The World</i> pursued in-depth coverage of the war in Gaza, including a week of hosting the program from the ground in Israel. The World's Shirin Jaafari has reported on wars for much of her career — from Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Ukraine to the Israel-Hamas war. As part of a multi-country trip to the Middle East, Jaafari accompanied the Jordanian air force on an aid drop over Gaza — a reporting effort that took weeks to arrange and mere hours from the time permission was granted to travel across the Iraq-Jordan border and board the flight. This type of bold, in-depth international journalism that brings listeners close to the people living the headlines is The World's trademark.</p> 

<p><i>The World</i> searches out new perspectives on the biggest stories, while also finding moments of joy that keeps our audience connected across continents.</p>
