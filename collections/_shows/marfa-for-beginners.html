<p><a href="https://www.marfapublicradio.org/podcast/marfaforbeginners"><i>Marfa For Beginners</i></a> is a podcast about the romantic art town of the same name in the middle of the West Texas desert. The first podcast out of Marfa Public Radio, <i>Marfa For Beginners</i> features episodes with a distinct sound — from "The End of Tinder," a story about love and loneliness and what happens when you swipe to the end of a dating app in a small city, to "The Longest Shortest Day," about how time functions differently in the desert. This year, the podcast was recognized for excellence in innovation with an national Edward R. Murrow Award.</p> 

<p><i>Marfa For Beginners</i> reaches listeners with the help of PRX infrastructure — hosted on PRX's Dovetail and available to public radio stations via the PRX Exchange. It's also a podcast championed by PRX from its beginnings. Our content development team worked closely as consultants with Marfa Public Radio to help develop and produce <i>Marfa For Beginners</i> and <i>So Far From Care</i>, a podcast about access to reproductive healthcare. PRX also supported the station's general podcast and media strategy, helping Marfa Public Radio reconceptualize their work as a future-focused station.</p>    

<p><strong>Efficiency, innovation, and community engagement are key to becoming a station that is ready for the next generation.</strong> With guidance from PRX, Marfa Public Radio has rethought how they serve listeners and exist as a free public service, responding to shortcomings in how public radio stations have operated in the past. PRX's hands-on work with stations is part of how we are helping future-proof public media infrastructure. It's also key to our mission — we want support for public media stations to be synonymous with PRX.</p>
