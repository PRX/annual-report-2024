<p><a href="https://www.wgbh.org/podcasts/the-big-dig"><em>The Big Dig</em></a> dissects cynicism about American infrastructure through an infamous decades-long effort to rebuild Boston&apos;s crumbling elevated highway underground. Recognized with a <a href="https://medium.com/prxofficial/the-big-dig-podcast-from-gbh-news-and-prx-wins-a-peabody-award-7c60328317b0">Peabody</a> award, <em>The Big Dig</em> is GBH News&apos; first significant venture into limited series podcasting hosted by Ian Coss, a founding member of PRX Productions. The show and its radio version is made available to listeners and stations through PRX&apos;s digital infrastructure — <a href="https://www.prx.org/publishing-platform">Dovetail</a> and the <a href="https://www.prx.org/exchange">Exchange</a>.</p>
<p>Distribution and ad technology isn&apos;t the most glamorous part of podcasting, but it is a critical factor in how creators bring their shows to market. It also plays an essential role in the future of PRX and digital audio. Dovetail from PRX is the only non-profit podcast publishing platform for state-of-the-art distribution, metrics, and ad sales that matches the quality of commercial products — it is accessible for independent creators and local public media stations, but also powerful enough to attract national and global partners like the <a href="https://prx.org/smithsonian">Smithsonian</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/prxofficial/prx-to-distribute-cond%C3%A9-nasts-slate-of-podcasts-7f45e77966e7">Condé Nast</a>.</p> 
<p>PRX technology undergirds the success and sustainable growth of our broadcast and podcast portfolio. By building our own privacy-forward infrastructure, PRX technology allows producers to maintain independence, be heard widely, and unlock new revenue potential. PRX&apos;s expertise, reliable data, and genuine investment in our partner&apos;s perspectives gives the organizations, stations, and producers we work with confidence in PRX support for their programming. Our platforms are the critical infrastructure protecting producers, the open podcasting ecosystem, and listeners — and PRX&apos;s ethical technology is becoming an ever-more essential part of what makes media work.</p>
