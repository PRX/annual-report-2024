<p><a href=”https://revealnews.org/”><i>Reveal</i></a> from the Center for Investigative Reporting, <i>Mother Jones</i>, and PRX, together with the Center for Public Integrity, brought a historically compelling multi-part series “40 Acres and a Lie” to public radio airwaves. Airing on more than 507 stations across the US and available to podcast listeners everywhere, the series uncovered the often-misunderstood government program that gave formerly enslaved people land titles in the wake of the Civil War — referred to as “40 Acres and a Mule” — only to take the land back.</p>

<p>Exploring a wealth gap that remains today, this special series also identified more than 1,200 people who received — but then lost — their land under the program and tracked down 41 living descendants, several of whom were unaware of the intergenerational wealth denied to their families.</p>

<p>Striking a nerve, the series prompted conversations across US public media and beyond, with reporters behind the series joining WNYC in New York, WDET in Detroit, Michigan, WUSF in Tampa, Florida, KUT in Austin, Texas, WABE in Atlanta, Georgia, NPR’s “Fresh Air,” PBS, CNN, and more to discuss their revelations.</p>

<p><blockquote>It is this type of consequential content — reporting sparks deeper reflection — that is central to PRX&apos;s portfolio.</blockquote></p>

<p>As America’s first weekly investigative public radio show and podcast, <i>Reveal</i> holds a special place in public media and audio, exemplifying our commitment as production and distribution partners to delivering high-value, high-quality storytelling to audiences.</p>
