<p>A few years ago, I was asked how I got into nonprofit work. I heard myself say it always starts with rebellion, followed by dissatisfaction, which gives way to hope. Hope is one of those things that can link our past, present, and our future.</p> 

<p>In 2003, PRX was founded with a vision to revolutionize the way we create, distribute, and consume audio content. We set out on this journey with a few pioneers who dared to dream big, and with the support and dedication of our ever-growing community of creators, producers, listeners, and supporters, we have transformed that dream into a reality.</p>

<p>Over the past year, PRX has paved the way for:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Diverse and Impactful Content.</b> We have been at the forefront of curating and distributing diverse, thought-provoking, and entertaining content that has captivated audiences around the world.</li>
    <li><b>Impactful Partnerships.</b> We believe that the return on relationships is often greater than the return on investments. We have partnered with the best in our field and we champion their success on their own terms.</li>  
    <li><b>Training and Content Development Initiatives.</b> Our commitment to generously sharing our knowledge has empowered aspiring creators and enriched the media landscape by nurturing the next generation of talent.</li>
    <li><b>Influence on Public Media.</b> PRX has played a pivotal role in reshaping public media by embracing new technologies, distribution methods, and content formats. Our impact extends beyond our own organization, influencing the broader media landscape.</li>
</ul>    
    
<p>As we reflect on the last year, we are not only celebrating our recent accomplishments, but also looking forward to a new year filled with innovation, growth, and opportunities. The media landscape continues to evolve, and we are committed to leading the way, ensuring that public media remains a powerful and relevant force.</p>

<p>We want to express our deepest gratitude to all of you — our network partners, creators, and listeners — for your unwavering commitment to PRX. Without your support and creativity, none of these achievements would have been possible.</p>
    
<p>Thank you for choosing to journey with us this year and for your support of the transformative stories yet to be told.</p>
    
<p>Warmest regards,</p>
